   **Pycro-manager architecture overview.** (Grey) The existing parts of ÂµManager provide generic microscope control abstracted from specific hardware, a graphical user interface (GUI), a Java plugin interface, and an acquisition engine, which automates various aspects of data collection. (Orange) Pycro-Manager enables access to these components through Python over a network-compatible transport layer, as well as a concise, high-level programming interface for acquiring data. These provide integration of data acquisition with  (purple) Python libraries for hardware control, data visualization, scientific computing, etc.
